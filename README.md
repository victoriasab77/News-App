- install any device you like;
- after successfull instalation run the emulator before running our project;
- then run expo to run our project by npx expo start;
- if Metro builder doesn't run the first time, or if you get an error, close the project from the recents emulator and run on android again from the metro builder, don't close the project with only the running project from the latest on the emulator;
- then it should work
